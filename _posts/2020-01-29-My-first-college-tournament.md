This might be a bit different from my regular posts, which mostly is regarding tech. But this is an experience that I really wanted to share, so here it goes!

## Organising the tournament

As a first year student, I was eager to join the sports comittee and help set up all necessary resources for the tournament hosted during our fest time. We sought out sponsors and negotiated deals with them. Also, we submitted various jersey designs for our teams and got them printed. The most difficult part was the manual labour we did as first year students, lifting all chairs and other required things from the sports department to the football field. This annoying chore was often passed onto first years by our seniors, who had to do this themselves a few years back.

## Our first match

It was my first time playing a tournament since high school, where I had participated in the CBSE Clusters. The whistle blew and the match started. It was exciting and closely fought. Both teams played well, but the score remained 1-1 after regular time, so it went to penalties. The tension was high as players took their shots. Our team kept calm and scored all their penalties, while the other team missed one. We won 4-3 in the shootout, and the celebration after the victory was amazing!

## Into the semi-finals

We beat a few more teams and climbed up the brackets, reaching the semis. In the semifinals, we played against a strong sports-focused college. The match was really close, with both teams playing hard. Every moment felt important, and even though we gave our best, we lost by a small margin. It was tough, but we were proud of how we played and learned a lot for next time.


While it was difficult to accept that the tournament was over for us, we were consoled by the various fest activities and DJ nights that were organized. We accepted the defeat and came back with more determination in training the very next day.
