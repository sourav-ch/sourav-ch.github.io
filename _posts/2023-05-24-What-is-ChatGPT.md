Last week, I was watching BBC News when they covered the latest technologies set to amaze people in 2023. The first story was about ChatGPT, and as soon as I heard the name, it immediately caught my attention. ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot developed by OpenAI. What really intrigued me was how it’s not just a typical chatbot, but one that feels more like having a conversation with a real person. That’s when I decided to explore it further, and the more I learned, the more fascinating it became.

ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM) trained on vast amounts of data, allowing it to predict and generate sentences that meet human needs. To make it more reliable, OpenAI trained ChatGPT using data from sources like Reddit discussions and code. It was also fine-tuned with a method called Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback, where the AI learns to respond to different human queries based on context. There’s a lot more behind the technology that powers this chatbot, but I’ll leave it to you to explore further. Who knows, someone reading this might even create the next big AI/ML model!

This new, human-like chatbot has quickly become one of the most captivating and accessible tools, surpassing daily usage of other social media platforms like WhatsApp and Twitter. Since its launch, it has rapidly gained 100 million users within just two months. ChatGPT’s dataset includes around 300 billion words and 175 billion parameters, enabling it to generate essays, paragraphs, stories, and more. It could even surpass Google in daily searches, as it offers direct answers to user queries rather than just a list of links. I have used it myself for code snippets and silly doubts at work, sometimes even before googling.

ChatGPT has some downsides, such as providing incorrect or illogical answers, like suggesting it’s safe to swim in a bowl of water. It can also reflect biased or harmful comments due to the data it was trained on, leading to conflicts in sensitive discussions. Additionally, it struggles with complex topics that require emotional understanding or deep analysis, like interpreting literature or understanding an author's perspective.

Some influential people fear that this technology might weaken our ability to think, which is what sets humans apart from other species. The discussion could go on, but I'll leave you with this: “Never stop pushing forward!” Thank you for reading.
