## How I Found Out About It
Joining the FOSS club opened the door to the world of open source and all the exciting activities within it. My first project, Hackbunch, came to life through this very program.

## Hackbunch
Hackbunch was my first project, and it not only introduced me to open source but also helped me complete all four pull requests (PRs) required for Hacktoberfest. Here's a brief overview of the PRs I submitted:

- PR1: Added a script to gather details and filter out unnecessary data.
- PR2: Integrated Flask for basic functionality.
- PR3: Developed the front-end using Bootstrap 4.
- PR4: Fixed an issue related to error handling.

## Activities as a Part of the amFOSS Club
amFOSS organized a program aimed at promoting open source, and I volunteered to be part of it. The program was not only fun but also very informative for everyone, including myself. It taught the basics of Git and introduced the open-source world to all participants. It played a key role in nurturing interest and encouraging others to get involved in open source.
