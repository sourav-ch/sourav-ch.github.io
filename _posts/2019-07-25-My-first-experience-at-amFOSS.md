Here’s my perspective on the journey of completing tasks for FOSS.

## Completing the Tasks
Initially, I was unsure whether to apply for BIOS or FOSS, but I’m glad I chose FOSS. It helped me fulfill many small dreams, and the experience has been incredible. Coding day and night, even while traveling, was like a dream come true. There were moments when I wished I had a hoodie to complete that “hacker” look, though! As a kid, I created a blog using Weebly templates, but I never felt it was enough. When I saw the FOSS task to create a blog, I felt really satisfied with the result. I hope to continue improving from here.

## Self-Evaluation

## Before FOSS
I always dreamed of becoming a coder. In 9th grade, I started learning HTML through YouTube videos. However, my coding journey took a pause during 10th, 11th, and 12th grades due to my JEE coaching. After joining Amrita, I had doubts about my path, but reading about FOSS on Quora reignited my enthusiasm. I picked up Python3 through YouTube and started building basic programs.

## After Completing the FOSS Tasks
FOSS has been a huge reason for my pride. After 10th grade, I didn’t feel proud of my achievements, as I faced constant setbacks. But after completing the tasks, staying up late to finish them, I can finally say I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished in the past few weeks. I’m genuinely grateful for this experience.

## What I Plan to Do in the Next 6 Months

## If I Get Into FOSS
Being accepted into FOSS would be a dream come true. Developing apps and websites is my passion, and FOSS is the perfect place to help me realize this dream. But if I do get in, I won’t stop there. I’ll aim to participate in GSoc and aspire to become a bug bounty hunter, with hopes of making it into a Hall of Fame. My dedication to the FOSS community and my goals will be even greater than it has been so far.

## If I Don’t Get Into FOSS
Even if I don’t get into FOSS, this won’t be the end of my journey. I’ll continue coding and improving my skills, preparing to apply again next semester. It might sound strange, but this is something I really want.

## Tasks I Haven’t Completed

## Task 3
This task really drew me in. After hours of work, I felt I was making progress, but ironically, I couldn’t finish it. I created a program that pulls links from a page, but I kept running into syntax errors when trying to access a class. Despite hours of searching for a solution, I couldn’t fix it.

## Task 5, Task 6, and Task 10
I was eager to complete these tasks, but due to all the assignments I had, I couldn’t manage them. There were nights I stayed up until 3 AM trying to complete the tasks. I did manage to take part of the code from Task 5, but couldn’t verify it since I didn’t have a Twitter developer account.

## Task 4
I made several attempts to finish this task, but I encountered errors while running the program. I suspect it might be because I was using Python3. I couldn’t figure it out and ended up leaving it for last.

## My Mentor
Although it’s not necessary to mention, I want to express how fortunate I am to have had a mentor with such passion. My mentor was always available, no matter the time of day, to review my code. He also offered valuable suggestions for improving my work and guided me on what I could do next. I haven’t asked for permission to reveal his name, but I may update this later.
