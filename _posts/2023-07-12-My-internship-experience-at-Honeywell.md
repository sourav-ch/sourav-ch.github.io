description: My Internship Experience at Honeywell - Learning, Growth, and New Adventures
---

My internship at Honeywell was an experience I will never forget. Over the course of a few months, I had the chance to work on some exciting and challenging projects, learn valuable technical skills, and explore a new city—Bangalore. The combination of work, learning, and adventure made this internship one of the most memorable periods of my life.

## Project 1: Dashboard for Test Platform

One of my primary tasks during the internship was creating a Dashboard for the Test Platform. The goal of this dashboard was to give users an easier and more insightful understanding of product performance and test executions for each release. The project involved designing a visually appealing and intuitive dashboard that displayed key metrics, trends, and test results in real time.

I worked closely with my team to ensure the dashboard was user-friendly and effectively communicated complex data. We used various visual elements like charts, graphs, and tables to present the data in a clear, actionable way. This project helped me sharpen my skills in Fullstack development, data visualization, and dashboard development, and gave me a great sense of accomplishment when the final product was delivered.

## Project 2: Windows Forms Application for System Monitoring

Another project I worked on involved creating a Windows Forms Application in the .NET framework that monitors system health, services, and application pools. The tool provided real-time insights into the status of various system components, allowing users to easily track performance and detect potential issues. One of the most interesting features I implemented was the ability to Start/Stop Application Pools, which allowed users to control their application pools directly from the application interface.

This project introduced me to system monitoring and management, and I gained a deeper understanding of how Windows services and application pools work. I also had the opportunity to improve my skills in Windows Forms development and gain hands-on experience with real-time systems.

## Learning and Personal Growth

The technical skills I gained at Honeywell were invaluable, but what made the experience truly enriching was the environment I worked in. I had the chance to collaborate with talented and experienced professionals who were always willing to help and provide guidance. The mentorship I received helped me grow both as a developer and as a problem-solver.

Another highlight of the internship was the group of friends I met during my time at Honeywell. We bonded over shared interests, long coffee breaks, and working together on challenges. It was inspiring to work alongside such motivated and passionate individuals, and they made the internship experience even more enjoyable.

## Exploring Bangalore

Beyond work, I was also able to explore the vibrant city of Bangalore. As someone new to the city, I was excited to experience its unique blend of culture, food, and technology. From visiting iconic landmarks like Cubbon Park and Lalbagh Botanical Garden to exploring local markets and trying out the famous cuisine, Bangalore offered something new every day.

The city is known as the Silicon Valley of India, and being surrounded by so much innovation and creativity was truly inspiring. On weekends, my friends and I would explore new places, try local foods, and even attend tech meetups. It was the perfect balance between work and play, and I felt lucky to be in a city that nurtured both my professional and personal growth.

## The final month

My last month was quite stressful, with rumours floating around regarding full-time employee offers.  With the economy in recession, there was an announcement that conversions would be very less. From around 120 interns, only 23 were converted. I was promised by my mentor that I would be converted as he was impressed by my performance. He kept his word as I was one of the 23 interns, who would join Honeywell back as a full time employee. The friendships I made here are something I will cherish for a lifetime. The opportunity to work on meaningful projects, learn from industry experts, and explore a new city made this internship a unique and unforgettable chapter in my career journey. I’m excited to carry forward the knowledge, skills, and experiences I gained at Honeywell into my future endeavors.
