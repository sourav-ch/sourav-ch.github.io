Felt appropriate to title this the way I have as I begin my college life at Amrita University, where I am going to be studying Computer Science. I’ve decided to start a blog to share my experiences. This is my first time blogging, so it’s a completely new adventure for me. In high school, I was focused on my studies and also had the privilege of being the captain of the football team.

Now, as I start college, I want to document everything—from academics to sports to personal growth. I hope this blog helps me reflect on my journey and connect with others who might be going through similar experiences. It’s a way for me to keep track of how I’m changing and learning along the way.

Excited to see what comes next!
