  description: College was a blast! I spent my days diving into computer science,
               and my nights leading the football team as captain. 
               Balancing coding assignments with game strategies taught me a ton about time management and staying calm under pressure. 
               The teamwork skills I picked up in football really helped me in group projects, and vice versa. 
               It was all about staying focused, working together, and having fun along the way!

  description: I kicked off my journey with a 6-month internship where I got hands-on experience with Full Stack Development and automation, 
               understanding and learning crucial industry software.
               I’m currently working as a software developer at Honeywell, 
               where I get to dive into both full-stack development and automation projects. 
               It’s been a great mix of coding, problem-solving, and making processes more efficient. 
               On the side, I’ve also been exploring Data Science and getting my head around things like LLMs (Large Language Models). 
               It’s exciting to learn how all these technologies fit together and how they can shape the future of software development!
